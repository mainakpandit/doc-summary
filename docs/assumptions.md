# Assumptions

Ambiguous calls made during the build, logged as they happen.

- **`make dev` runs `npm install` in `frontend/` when `node_modules` is missing.**
  The Makefile spec (task_breakdown.md step) didn't list this explicitly, but
  CLAUDE.md behavior 6 requires `make dev` to succeed from a fresh clone, and
  a fresh clone has no `frontend/node_modules`. Guarded so it's a no-op once
  deps are installed.
